## OBJECTS
- object initializer
    - Objects can be initialized with new Object(), Object.create() *or* using the *literal notation* (initializer notation) which is a list of key value pairs inside curly braces.
## CLASSES
- inheritance
    - JavaScript is prototype based and as such nearly all objects are instances of Object which sits atop the prototype chain. Javascript objects have a link to a prototype object.
- classes
    - classes are a template for creating objects. Classes act as special functions and have two components, class-expressions and class-declarations.
## DESTRUCTURING
- destructuring assignment
    - a JS expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.
## REST
- rest parameters
- a function's last parameter can be prefixed with ... which will cause all remaining arguments to be placed in an array.
### SPREAD
- spread syntax(...)
    - spread syntax allows an iterable to be expanded where zero or more elements or arguments are expected.
### FUNCTION DEFAULTS
- default parameters
    - default function parameters allow named parameters to be initialized with default sums if no value or 'undefined' is passed.
