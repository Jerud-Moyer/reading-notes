## The past, present and future of local storage for web apps

- Diving in
    - web apps need localStorage
    - cookies can be used but have downsides
        - slow down
        - unencrypted
        - limited to about 4 kb
    - what we want
        - more storage
        - on the client
        - persists beyond page refresh
        = isn't transmitted to server
    -  hacks before HTML5
        - browser specific or 3rd party plugins
- Introducing HTML% storage
    - or *web storage*
    - most browsers support now
    - store key value pairs locally
- using HTML5 storage
    - store data based on a named key, then retrieve that data with same named key
    - setItem will overwrite previous data (same name key)
    - getItem with noexisten key will return null
- tracking changes to storage area
    - trap data storage event
- limitations in current browsers
- HTML5 storage in action
    - stringify
    - data is stored as strings
    - parse
- beyond named key-value pairs


## CSS
### chapter 15 - layout

- key concepts in positioning elements
    - block-level els
        - if one sits in the other, the outer el is the parent
        - start on new line
    - inline els
        - flow in between surrounding text
- controlling the position of elements
    - positioning schemes
        - normal flow
            - each block element appears below the last. regardless of width.
        - relative positioning
            - moves an element but not the others
        - absolute positioning
            - positions the element relative to its parent. out of normal flow, does nor=t affect position of others. move as users scroll
        - fixed positioning
            - a form of absolute that positions element in relation to browser window as apposed to parent element. do not affect others, do not move on scroll
        - floating elements
            - allows you to take out of normal flow and position to far right or far left of containing box. becomes block element around which others can flow.
        - when you move any element from normal flow, it can overlap. z-index property allows you to decide which will be on top.
- more on this
    - normal flow
        - position: static
        - each new el sits on top of the next one
        - el start on a new line regardless of width
    - relative positioning
        - moves an el in relation to where it would have been in normal flow
        - position: relative
        - ie top: 10px moves 10px lower
            - left: 100px moves 100px to right
    - absolute positioning
        - position: absolute
        - box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other els on the page
        - offset properties specify where it should be in relation to it's parent
    - fixed positioning
        - position: fixed
        - positions element in relation to browser window
        - when user scrolls, el stays in same place
- overlapping els
    - z-index
        - in relative, fixed or absolute, els can overlap
        - z-index property lets you decide which should appear on top
        - its value is a number
        - els with higher numbers appear on top of those lower
- floating els
    - float
        - take an el in normal flow and position as far left or right as parent allows
        - use with width property to determain positioning
    - using float to place els side by side
        - height of box can affect where els sit
    - clearing floats
        - clear:
        saying that el should touch direction (l,r,t,b) of parent
    - parents of floated els: problem
        - if a box contains only floated els it can appear collapsed in certain browsers
        - solution
            - overflow: auto
            - width: 100%
    - multi-column layouts with floats
        - use a div for each column
        - use width:
        - float:
        - margin:
    - screen sizes
        - different sized screens show different amounts of information 
        - also different resolution
        - designers often try to create pages around 960-1000 px wide
        - let users know what to expect in top 600 px of screen
    - fixed width layouts
        - advantages
            - pixel  values are accurate
            - designer has more control
            - size of inage will remain the same
        - disadvantages
            - you can end up with big gaps around edge of page
            - if user screen is higher res. page can look smaller and text harder to read
            - if user increases font size, text might not fit in alloted
            - works best on devices like laptop or desktop
            - page will ofetn ytake up more verticle space thatn liquid layout with same content
    - liquid layouts
        - advantages
            - pages expand to fill entire browser window
            - if user has small window page can contract to fit without user having to scroll to the side.
            - design is tolerant of user setting font sizes larger
        - disadvantages 
            - if you dont control the width of sections of page the design can look very different than you intend
            - if user has wide window text lines can become long
            - if a fixed width item is in a box too small( because user mad e window smaller) image can overflow text
- a fixed width layout
    - width of main boxes specified in pixels
- a liquid layout
    - uses percentages to specify the width of each box so that the design will stretch to fit the size of the screen
    - give body width: 90%
- layout grids
    - 960 pixel grid used widely by web designers
    - grids set consistent proportions and spaces between items
    - 960 pixel wide 12 column grid offers many layout options
- css frameworks
    - advantages
        - save you from writing repeat code
        - tested across different browser versions
    - disadvantages
        - often require use of html class names that only control presentation and not content
        - code bloat
    - using 960.gs grid
        - put in html css link
