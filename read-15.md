## Silicon Valley's gender gap is the result of computer game maketing 20 years ago
- in 2014 70% of all employees at to tech companies were male
- in technical rle roles the nimbers are even worse
- the separation began in the 80s and has continued to worsen
- marketing campaigns may be to blame
- programming is one of the most lucrative skills you can have and the industry is growing
- unfortunateley women continue to not have the same opportunities in the field

### marketing games
- early computing was very gaming-centric
     - these games were primarily marketed to boys and men
        - apple ad
        - 'gameBOY'
    - leading to chicken and egg cycle of male ads / male users
### The experience gap widens
 - Numbers from Carnegie Mellon University in 1995 show men passing computer science placement rates and women not. This is a result of young men buying/using computers more because they were the gtarget audience of advertisers
    - youmg women start out behind and struggle to catch up
    - even when women  do have experience with coding, the male dominated tech environment still creates an obstacle for entry

## Diversity in Tech

## Why diversity matters to your tech company
- As the push for diversity in tech continues, a growing number of companies and leaders are confronting the topic for the first time.
- those new to the concept often dont know how to talk about it
- Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders
- leaders must understand WHY it matters
- studies show that diversity offers significant benefits for teams focused on creativity and innovation
- Diverse companies perform better
    - diverse teams are smarter and more creative
    - “female representation in top management leads to an increase of $42 million in firm value.”
        - wowsa!
    - And in a 2003 study looking at 177 banks across the U.S., researchers found that for banks focused on innovation, racial diversity was clearly tied to better financial performance. 
    - companies are losing out on great talent
        - Slack Engineering Chief of Staff Nolan Caudill acknowledged: "Like almost every tech company, our own upbringings, biases and life experiences result in referral networks that are very homogeneous, and we know we are missing out on great candidates based on these shortcomings."
- Diverse companie can better serve a diverse user base
    -  When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result.
        - haha!
- it's the right thing to do
