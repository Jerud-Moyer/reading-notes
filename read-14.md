### some ideas for project week
- recipe app
    - get recipes from maybe a couple of different food apis
    - fill out a form to store recipes in  a database and access them later
- taco app
    - alot like the recipe app but just for tacos
    - using the taco fancy api
    - daily taco on login!
- music albums app
    - user enters an album name or artist get back album art and info
    - would have to further research apis for this. Maybe Spotify for Developers could work.
- all ideas would have full stack with a React front end to display everything for user.
