### chapter 1 - Structure
 websites are electronic versions of real life things
    newspapers
    catalogs
    forms
    etc.
we use the same types of 'structure' to make these in electronic form.
when we build websites, HTML descibes the structure. We break things up into elements and give them tags. These axct like containers for information, text, images, etc.
opening tags have corresponding closing tags. we can add attributes to the opening tags yhese tell us more about the containers. attributes come with names and values. yopu will usually have body head and title elements at the very least.
head contains information *about the page* title is *name shown at top of browser* info on how to start a webpage on pc vs mac. content managment systems ie. blogging platforms or ecommerce sites. these allow *non coders* to contribute content. Using text editors. to learn HTML we need to learn the tags and what they can do.

### chapter 8 - Extra Markup

evolving versions of HTML. HTML 5 *work in progress* important to indicate DOCTYPE WITHIN HEAD you can make comments IN HTML so info vcan be hidden from  user. You can assign 'id' attribute to HTML elements. also class attributes. there are block elements and inline elements you can use to group text together. iframes allow us to bring in tools and things from other pages like maps and stuff. information about the page (meta) lives in HEAD. There are special 'escape characters available.
