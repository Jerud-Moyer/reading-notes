## applying atomic design

### part 1
- start big and work your way down (visually breaking down components)
    - organisms are large sections we can easily extract from the page
    -  these can be broken down to contain smaller organisms or _molecules_
    - molecules are usually repeatedly used in several places on the page
    - next is atoms
        - basic html elements like labels, inputs, buttons
### part 2
- start small and work your way up (actually building)
- for compnents to be usable and composable, they need to be as small and independant as possible
- create atoms, then molecules, thn organisms
### more examples

## thinking in React
- start with a mock
- break the UI into a component hierarchy
- build a static version in React
- identify the minimal representation of UI state
## callbacks
### what are JS callbacks
- what is a callback
    - a function that is to be executed after another function has finished executing
    - any function passed as an argument and called by the function that recieves it is a callback function
- create a callback
### javascript callback functions
- 
### first class functions
- assign a function to a variable
- pass a function as an argument
- return a function
### MDN callback function
